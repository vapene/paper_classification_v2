# Classification of Contamination Patterns of Recyclable Paper through a Hierarchical Ensemble Model

Paper Classification AI
This is an implementation of paper classification module designed for combinatorial project. 
The original code is based on An Ensemble of Simple Convolutional Neural Network Models for MNIST Digit Recognition, dataset is self-made.

## Environment 
Below is a list of notable packages and their versions.

python                    3.7.0  
numpy                     1.21.5 
opencv                    3.4.2 
pytorch                   1.12.1    
scipy                     1.7.3  
torchvision               0.13.1  

## Training

Training can be done by running the main.py file with python.
Other baseline models can be run by giving argument. ex) to run resnet50, give --models "resnet". Full code is available at sleep.sh file.

Detailed configuration can be found in param_parser.py file.
